            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PROPOSALLS OF THE COMMITTEE For Regulating the LAW, both in Sense, Form, and Practice; Communicated to publick view by especiall Order and Command.</head>
            <p>WE the Commissioners of the grand and weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Regulating the Law, which have taken no small pains in sitting all this while, with the assistance of a single-soald Minister, have at last grown big of these high and mighty Articles, and desire to be delivered of them into the World for the publick applause and consent: for by them we hope to give a free interpretation of <hi>Modern Iustice,</hi> and a strict account of the reformation of all fees, tedious demurs, and practice of Courts, that by it the Commonwealth may be eased of the burthen of unknown charges which waits upon buckeram baggs, and we richly rewarded for our sweat and travell in so acceptable and laudable a work.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Proposall</hi> 1. That whereas all the good Laws, Statutes, and Acts of Grace in this Kingdom, have been derived clearly from Noble and Heroick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their free Grant; and (untill they shall be repeald by a Knack of Parliament) are the sole tye and safety of humane Society, Trade, and Traffique; It is thought fit, That the charity and love of former Kings to their Liege People, be esteemed nothing to the mercy of the State we now live under, and the famous Liberties, Properties, and Bounty of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirits we partake; And that it shall be thought reason and Law both, That an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> may take the Wall of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> though it be in the middle of Lincolns-Inne-Fields, and in all Causes and over all Persons to be Supreme Moderator.</item>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56988:2"/>
               <item>2 That the Sword was the first inventer of Kings, and the present upholder of States and Parliaments; and therefore notwithstanding any right or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the contrary, the Sword is the best Lawgiver; and as it has attempted already to cut off the head of the Commonwealth, so it does require all the rest of the members to an observance of his command, be it never so unjust, inhumane, cruell, sacrilegious, or prophane.</item>
               <item>3 That in all administration of modern Iustice, we may be no more bound to Conscience, than Conscience is to us: for let a man look over all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy of the Law-givers, it is impossible to conjecture in what part of that body Conscience lyes.</item>
               <item>4 That the <hi>Kings Bench Bar</hi> be subservient to the High Court of Iustice, in regard the one has no power but meerly to distribute <hi>Ius suum cui{que}</hi> the candid censure of the Law between man and man, the other has a Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above Sovereigns.</item>
               <item>5 That the Court of Iniquity, alias the Chancery (where a man may be suspended and demurd in his just right from generation to generation, by the power of the purse) may be judged no more by the <hi>Keepers of the Liberties and privileges of England,</hi> but rather to be taken in its true and genuine sence by the Preservers of the controversies and sins of the people; and whereas a man after the expence of 1000 pounds to bring his sute to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, was used to be blown off with a non-assumption of the Engagement, they shall henceforth be allowed 20 shillings towards their costs and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the half dozen Clerks dagled gowns scowred.</item>
               <item>6 That that bloody and deadly Term <hi>Murderaverunt</hi> may be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a word in fashion, and because it concernes many of great quality, it is ordered, that it be alwaies written in <hi>Capitall Letters.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7 That as many as <hi>Swornaverunt</hi> themselves into the high stile of the Knights of the Post, are not a jot concerned in the Act of degrading late honours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but this being an antient order of Knighthood, and very ready at all times through the course of these ten years past to bestead the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth upon occasion, be it therefore confirmed by all the sinnews of Law, that this Fraternity be upheld to perpetuity of ages.</item>
               <item>8 That no <hi>Adjournamentums</hi> of causes shall henceforth be allowed; for suppose a man having but one poor <hi>Cot<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>agium</hi> in the world, have a sute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending <hi>oro Cabagio, Anglicè,</hi> a Cabbage, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, and withall a Iudgment and Execution, the Plaintiff must be constrained perhaps to wait a twelve-moneth for satisfaction, and to be paid in his own Coyn.</item>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56988:2"/>
               <item>9 That it shall be held fit in a Circult or Assize, though it become not a Judge <hi>Itinerant,</hi> with his bunch of gravity on his chin, to take bribes, yet it may be convenient that the price of a pair of gloves, called 50 peices, be deposed in his Clerks pocket to be presented to his Lordship the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when he goes to wash his hands, that like <hi>Pilate</hi> he might purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the world in formality and circumstance, as in the case of <hi>Martin San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Steyner.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>10 That all Attorneys of Courts errant, passant, or regardant, may no more run up their Clients with twelve-pence wet, and six-pence dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Baytings, Breakfasts, Collations, and <hi>Banbury</hi> Cheeses; but that justice may run clear without proclivity or irregular buggering of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymans purse, it is ordered <hi>Cum warranto</hi> that the pettifogger shall require no more than his ten groats, and if so be the free-hearted Client tickle him under the short ribs with an ordinary of boyld beef at Fetter Lane end <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> it shall be thought a considerable <hi>Easeamentum</hi> of expence, and no more to be extorted for expedition.</item>
               <item>11 That all dashes whatsoever used in writing shall be held for a <hi>Capitall Crime,</hi> for under the notion of a <hi>Counter stroke,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Latin Cases</hi> were so martyr'd that it puzzled the worshipfull the Judges (having forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Grammer by long experience) to understand them, and therefore it is desired, that all words be written at length, and not in figures, for the conveniency of the Benchers.</item>
               <item>12 That it may be thought reason, that the word <hi>Villenagium</hi> be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expunged out of the terms of the Law, since we are all free-men and no more slaves than they which row in the Turks Galleys.</item>
               <item>13 That by the motion of Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> the Term <hi>Simony</hi> may be looked upon as convenient, if not lawfull, since the first day he begun to sell the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of <hi>Southwales.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>14 That the right heir at Law is he alone that is in possession, and as by the outing of the best tenure in <hi>England,</hi> we see it apparent, <hi>inter arn a silent leges,</hi> so whosoever he be that is born to an estate, unlesse he can derive his claim from the Engagement, he is no longer to be suffered by the Sheriff of the County to live in peace, till such time as he has run the gauntlop at Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdashers Hall, and then he shall be freely manumitted.</item>
               <item>15 That an under-Sheriff, a Jaylor, a Catch-pole, and Clerk of Assize being <hi>Individuums in natura,</hi> or <hi>termini convertibiles,</hi> shall no more be dashed in their reputation with the circumflex of a K. but rather to be considered as publique Officers which in this catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56988:3"/> Age ought to have a little touch of <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> in all their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</item>
               <item>16 That the Excize, notwithstanding there be no Law extant, or Conscience to warrant so sore an Imposition upon a Free-people, it may be thought <hi>Jure divino,</hi> because it enlarges the hawking-baggs of the Saints.</item>
               <item>17 That no expedition be henceforth used in any Court, practice, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, but rather all delayes and labyrinths to dwindle out a Bumpkins pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony to the last thrid. That the puny Clerks may be prevented in the vein of their spending-mony, and the masters of Offices may be enriched with double Fees to the capacity of buying of Bishops Lands and Fee-farm rents; Besides the Law being just shaking hands with us, it is necessary we make the most of it while it is here.</item>
               <item>18 That whereas a Country Solicitor, vampt up to the singularity of a vinegar cloak, and a green bag, is wont to dun the Offices with a pitifull importunity, more especially when his Novice is at hand to quicken him with a piece of four; it is desired he may make the benefit of a <hi>fallacia signi</hi> when the Term is ended, to keep his <hi>Vnder-vamper</hi> in Town to bear his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges untill the poor Fellow is compelled to pawn his Cloak in <hi>Long lane</hi> to carry him home, and then take his leave with a Philosophicall Bill of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at his back like an Indenture in Folio to bemoan his Lawship to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring friends.</item>
               <item>19 That the term <hi>Prerogative,</hi> being a sequestrable Phrase, a malignant and dangerous word, full of Plots and Treasons, a word pray'd and preach'd against by many wel-wishing and confiding Divines and godly Souls of this Nation, may be laid aside, and charmd into the happy conversion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Birth-right. And since the Representatives of the Plebeians have the managing of all Delinquent Incumbrances, Be it proposed to be enacted and made Law That all such Tyrannicall expressions, denominations, or Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be pocketted up, to raise the wages, salaries, stipendiaries or allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the aforesaid Representatives from this time forth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</item>
               <item>20 That whereas <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> have been the old Pronounes of distinguishing Titles and claims in this blind and ignorant patch of the World, in regard they are Latin, and so of grievous consequence to a <hi>People new-lighted,</hi> in respect of their alliance, relation, affinity, and consanguinity to the Pope, being their Countrey-man; Be it confirmed by a perpetuall Decree, That those words are no better
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56988:3"/> than Iesuits, and have nothing to doe with us in the decision of Rights of the new Modell.</item>
               <item>21 That the thing call'd a King, a Title of Usurpation, to whom by compulsion and imminent necessity men of greatest rank, Nobility, and Professions took most formally the Oathes of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: because we that are wiser than our Fore-fathers know there is an inconvenience in having any one above us to call us to an account, or controll the liberty of our Concupiscence; <hi>It is beseech'd,</hi> that all <hi>Britain,</hi> of what tongue, language or speech soever, would be pleased to forget that obligation, and to acknowledge no Supremacy but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</item>
               <item>22 That in all Contracts, Covenants, or Agreements, it shall be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for every man to have a mentall Reservation, or intricate meaning, that upon advantages we may turn weather-cocks, and adore those mighty and modern Deities, profit, and self-ends.</item>
               <item>23 That all Records or Registers of Antiquity may be burnt and imbez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeld, for fear lest in reading and turning over those slighted and moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Papers, we may unwillingly be put in mind of a neglected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten duty and obedience to Magistracy, Ministry, nay I had almost said Soveraignty.</item>
               <item>24 That every Country fellow may have the privilege of Pleading his own Cause, meerly to humour the high shooes, notwithstanding we in our known Wisdom and Integrity shall give sentence according to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and proper discretion.</item>
               <item>25 That all Committee-men shall be held forth Saints at their Death, and be enthron'd in the Church Windowes at the charge of the Parish; because they have been most eminent Instruments in the Ingrossing and Monopolizing of all Church-Lands, Gleab and Tythes.</item>
               <item>26 That there may be a Provinciall Pare-royall of Iudges selected for the determining of Sutes in the same Country where they first take breath; Alwayes provided, that if the partyes be rich, fat, and well liking, and of good credit in the Sheriffs books, and withall able to endure the heat of a <hi>London</hi> Tryall, That in such cases there must and ought to be a further appeal to our Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where such differences are most peculiarly required to be decided with a wet finger.</item>
               <item>27 That the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> or an Injunction for a man to discover
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56988:4"/> himself against himself, has alwayes been held a most injurious Circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and unjust invention amongst Grandees, (except in matters of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration) it shall be lawfull henceforward for no man to unrip, untruss, or divulge the least syllable of his own privity or hidden knowledge of deluding, deceiving, or couzening the Commonalty, against his own Conscience.</item>
               <item>28 That the damnable expensive Fees of all Offices and Officers shall be brought to an <hi>Abatamentum,</hi> and be left to the pleasure of every mans heart to gratulate and requite his Trustee; And so the Lawyers being brought into subjection to the mercy of the Bores and Swadds, they may not flaunt so stately in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> being but publique servants, and a hickle of Animals, which breath by the iniquities of the Land.</item>
               <item>29 That whereas Incontinence has been evermore held by the Antients a most decryed and punishable vice, and trick of youth in most Countries, it is conceived fit to be esteemed veniall, and more pardonable in this cold cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and to permit all men of experienced activity the freedom of a Wife and an Intimate, for the fructifying of the Sister-hood, and the enlargement of the number of the <hi>Geneva</hi> frie.</item>
               <item>30 That the old Proverb <hi>(Change is no Robbery)</hi> be put in practice in these modern times. And whereas the grievous and mighty tax called Ship-money imposed by the Royalists hath been esteem'd Tyranny, Injustice, and Covetousness: The easie and frivolous Sess of 60000 lib. a Moneth loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Reformed sighers and groaners shall be construed by all sorts of pay-masters a trifle, a piece of <hi>Nothingness,</hi> necessary to the supportation of the Armies, and other small disbursements, which do not amount to half the summe.</item>
               <item>31 That whereas the taking up of Arms in former Ages against a Prince by his own Subjects, was by the Law found Treason; in respect that now we know he is but a man, obnoxious to death and mortality at pleasure, it shall no longer be judged Treason, but Convenience; and that such ought to be rewarded for it, under the notion of good service and gallantry.</item>
               <item>32 That whereas in Case of Manslaughter, and other casuall offences, men were allowed the benefit of their Clergy, it is granted necessary in this metamorphosis of things, that no man be put to his book again, for there is hardly one in a hundred can read his neck-verse, and so many of the good Intenders to the weal-publique may incur the hazard of the hempen twist.</item>
